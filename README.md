# Movie Trailer
## Introduction

**Movie trailer** project is a part of Udacity's _Programming Foundations with Python_ course, submitted by its student. 
It is a server-side code storing a list of movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. 
Upon running, it displays the list in a webbrowser, preformated and styled using freshtomatoes files. 

## Getting started

The project contains:
- entertainment_center.py
- fresh_tomatoes.py
- media.py 
- fresh_tomatoes.html (generated by _fresh_tomatoes.py_)
- this README.md

## Running

You can create your own list of favourite movies. 

1. Go to **entertainment_center.py** file 
2. Create instances of **media.py**'s Movie class
3. Input the instances in movies list.
4. Run the this python file.

In the default browser, you can see your favourite movies' box art imagery, title, and, by clicking on them, trailers, specified by you.
